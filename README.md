Overview of the project

Vulnerability Scanning Tool (Python)

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a simple vulnerability scanning tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations.

Key Activities:

Network Discovery: Identify hosts and devices on the network using protocols such as ICMP and ARP.
Port Scanning: Scan for open ports and services running on them.
Software Version Analysis: Analyze software versions and identify outdated or vulnerable versions.
Misconfiguration Detection: Detect misconfigurations in network devices, servers, and applications.
Vulnerability Reporting: Generate a report highlighting identified vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation.
Technologies Used:

Python:
Python 3.x (for implementing the vulnerability scanning tool)
Libraries:
scapy (for network discovery and port scanning)
nmap (for port scanning and OS detection)
python-nmap (for interacting with nmap)
requests (for web scraping and software version analysis)
BeautifulSoup (for web scraping and HTML parsing)
